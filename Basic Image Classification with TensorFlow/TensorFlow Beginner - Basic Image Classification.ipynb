    "Consider the following graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Single Neuron](images/1_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above graph simply represents the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y = w1 * x1 + w2 * x2 + w3 * x3 + b\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the `w1, w2, w3` are called the weights and `b` is an intercept term called bias. The graph above, therefore, is simply a graphical representation of a simple linear equation. The equation can also be *vectorised* like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y = W . X + b\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `X = [x1, x2, x3]` and `W = [w1, w2, w3].T`. The .T means *transpose*. This is because we want the dot product to give us the result we want i.e. `w1 * x1 + w2 * x2 + w3 * x3`. This gives us the vectorised version of our linear equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we are trying to ask, essentially, is if given a large amount of data (pairs of X and corresponding y), can we write an algorithm to figure out the optimal values of W and b? We need to find a way for our model to find the *optimal* values for W and b and not the absolute values. Absolute values probably don't even exist given the limitations of our mathematical model since we are *assuming* a linear function for a problem where it might be a much more complex one in reality and we don't know what that function is.\n",
    "\n",
    "By taking the observed data and a proposed model, we want to write an algorithm to learn the values for W and b which best fit the data and ultimately, by doing that, we learn an approximate function which maps the inputs to outputs of our data. This type of algorithm is called an _optimization_ algorithm and there are a few different optimization algorithms that are typically used in training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our problem, our examples are of shape`(60000, 28, 28)`. The first dimension is simply the number of examples we have, so each example is of the shape `(28, 28)`. If we unroll this array into a single dimension, it will become a `28 * 28 = 784` dimensional vector. Now, it can probably be modeled somewhat like a linear equation, right? Given features from `x1` to `x784`, we get an output `y`. Here, each pixel value is a feature in our examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Single Neuron with 784 features](images/1_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This may actually work for really simple problems but in our case, this model will turn out to be insufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turns out, we can learn much more complex functions by simply *cascading* the linear functions one after the other. The only additional thing that a node in a neural network does (as opposed to a node in a linear equation shown above) is that an activation function is applied to each linear output. The purpose of an activation functions is to help the neural network find non-linear patterns in the data because if we just cascaded the neurons or nodes like the ones described above, even with many layers of cascaded linear functions, the result will still be a linear function which means that, after training the mode, it will learn a linear function that best fit the data. This is a problem because in many, if not most cases, the input to output map is going to be much more complex than a linear function. So, the activation gives the model more flexibility, and allows the model to be able to learn non-linear patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, instead of setting y to a weighted sum of our input features, we can get a few hidden outputs which are weighted sums of our input features passed through an activation function and then get the weighted sums of those hidden outputs and so on. We do this a few times, and then get to our output y. This type of model gives our algorithm a much greater chance of learning a complex function.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Neural Network with 2 hidden layers](images/1_4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the network above, we have two *hidden layers*. The first layer with all the X features is called the input layer and the output y is called the output layer. In this example, the output has only one __node__. The hidden layer can have a lot of nodes or a very few nodes depending on how complex the problem may be. Here, both the hidden layer have 2 nodes each. Each node gives the output of a linear function after the linear output passes through an activation function, and takes inputs from each node of the preceding layer. All the W's and all the b's associated with all of these functions will have to be \"learned\" by our algorithm as it attempts to optimize those values in order to best fit the given data. Note that the total number of learnable parameters in any layer depend on the number of nodes in that layer as well as on the number of nodes in the preceding layer. For example, learnable parameters for __hidden layer 1__ can be calculated as: (number of nodes of the layer) * (number of nodes of preceding layer) + (number of nodes of the layer). Why? The first part is obvious: if every node of a layer is connected to every node of the preceding layer, we can simply multiply the number of nodes of these two layers to get the total number of weight parameters. Also, the __bias__ from previous layer would be connected to each node in the layer as well - that gives us the second term. So, for __hidden layer 1__, we get: `2 * 2 + 2 = 6` learnable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the hand-written digit classification problem, we will have 128 nodes for two hidden layers, we will have 10 nodes for the output layer with each node corresponding to one output class, and of course we already know that the input is a 784 dimensional vector."
